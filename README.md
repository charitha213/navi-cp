# Drug Risk Classification & Healthcare Management System



An ML-powered platform for proactive drug risk assessment and healthcare workflow optimization, bridging clinical and pharmaceutical operations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Drug Risk Prediction**: Machine learning model classifies medications as high/low risk
- **Alternative Drug Recommendations**: Suggests safer alternatives for high-risk prescriptions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Tailored interfaces for doctors, nurses, admins, and production staff
- **End-to-End Workflows**: From patient appointments to prescription safety checks
- **Production Flagging System**: Quality control for pharmaceutical manufacturing
